Akshar Audio Classification is a project focused on classifying audio recordings of Hindi letters using the Librosa library to extract the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from each audio file. The dataset used in this project consists of over 1000 audio recordings of each Hindi letter, providing a comprehensive and diverse sample set.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient classification model that can recognize and classify Hindi letters based on their audio characteristics. By utilizing the power of machine learning algorithms, the model can analyze and classify these audio files based on their unique sound patterns.

The Librosa library is a popular Python package for analyzing and processing audio signals. It is used in this project to extract the MFCCs from each audio file, which are a set of features that represent the spectral characteristics of the audio signal. These features are then used as inputs to a machine learning algorithm for classification.

The accuracy of the classification model is evaluated using a test set of audio recordings, which have not been seen by the model during training. The project also includes visualization of the MFCCs of the audio files, allowing for a better understanding of the characteristics of each letter.

The Akshar Audio Classification project has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as speech recognition systems, language learning software, and accessibility tools for individuals with hearing impairments
